# Cinematic video backgrounds from AnimatedWebs

1. **Find candidates.** Call `search_backgrounds` with the mood or subject the user wants, for example "aurora", "liquid chrome", "deep ocean" or "abstract dark". Show the best 3 with their preview links and the template each one powers.
2. **Get the file.** Call `get_background` for the chosen slug. With Pro it returns the clean MP4 link and a ready `<video>` snippet. Without Pro it returns the watermarked preview and names the plan that includes the clean file. Say so plainly, and never ship the watermarked preview as a final asset.
3. **Integrate it well.** Place the video behind the content as a muted, looping, inline, autoplaying layer with `object-fit: cover` and a poster image. Add a gradient or scrim so text meets WCAG contrast, and show the poster instead of the video when the user prefers reduced motion.
4. **Verify it** in a browser at desktop width and at 390px: it plays, loops without a visible jump, text stays readable and nothing scrolls sideways.
